# Desktop Migration Proposal

Project Overview: <br>
Building on the trust and confidence established early in my tenure at HFA, I was tasked with modernizing the existing PCs at the Los Angeles headquarters. This project involves transitioning from desktop computers to laptops for 50 workstations, ensuring that the new devices support multiple external monitors, additional peripherals via USB 3.0, robust physical security mechanisms, and a quick disconnect feature from the office environment.
<br><br>
Project Objectives: <br>
- Device Recommendations: Conduct comprehensive research to recommend laptop models that meet the technical and operational requirements for the modernized workstations.
- Detailed Configurations: Use a configurator tool to specify the detailed technical specifications of the recommended devices, ensuring all critical features are met.
- Assumptions Documentation: Carefully document any assumptions made during the analysis, including how requirements for upgrading monitors, peripheral connectivity, and security were evaluated.
- Business Proposal Preparation: Develop a three- to four-page business proposal that clearly outlines the modernization plan, recommendations, and configuration details.
